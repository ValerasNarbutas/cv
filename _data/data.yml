career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      As a self-motivated developer, I specialize in Microsoft 365 Modern workspace solutions such as SharePoint 2007/2010/2013/2016,
      SharePoint Online, MS Teams, PowerApps, Power Automate, Logic Apps, and Azure functions. With the ability to lead other developers 
      on projects and work effectively as part of a geographically distributed team, I take ownership of issues and problems and work them 
      through to resolution.
      
      My expertise includes standard methods, tools, and techniques for requirements definition, enabling me to produce detail-level functional
      requirement documentation. I am also experienced in implementing or managing risk management processes and tools.
      I actively seek ways to understand, mitigate or reduce risks, drawing on expert advice, risk assessment, and management reports.
        
      My knowledge extends beyond SharePoint to include the ability to discuss key benefits and drawbacks of existing online solutions,
      while keeping abreast of new technology developments in the intranet and webspace. I have good general knowledge with some detailed 
      knowledge of products/functions outside of SharePoint.

      As part of my commitment to the Microsoft community, I often contribute to Microsoft Patterns and Practices #sharingiscaring.
